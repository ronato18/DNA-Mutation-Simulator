# DNA-Mutation-Simulator
Auto-mutates DNA sequences, classifies mutation types, and detects STOP codons appear
# ðŸ§¬ DNA Mutation Simulator

This Python script simulates DNA mutations, detects the type (Silent, Missense, Nonsense), and stops when a STOP codon is found. Built as part of a bioinformatics learning journey.

## Features
- DNA â†’ RNA â†’ Protein Translation
- Auto-mutation with classification
- STOP codon detection

## Example
```bash
Original DNA:   ATGTTTCTT
Mutated  DNA:   ATGTTGCTT
ðŸ›‘ Nonsense Mutation
